Profile of apparmor didn't allow libvirtd to excute programs in /usr/local/bin, which is the default directory contains the "ovs-vsctl".

So we must modify the profile mannually to let libvirt work with ovs.

(1) sudo gedit /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.libvirtd
(2) find lines of:
```
  /bin/* PUx,
  /sbin/* PUx,
  /usr/bin/* PUx,
  /usr/sbin/* PUx,
```
(3) insert these two lines (notice ovs-vsctl is contained in /usr/local/bin):
```
  /usr/local/bin/* PUx,
  /usr/local/sbin/* PUx,
```
(4) save and exit gedit
(5) reload the profile with the command:
sudo /etc/init.d/apparmor reload

Now, I can successfully start VMs connected to an ovs bridge!
